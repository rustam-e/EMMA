2.  get a six pack and a lot of likes - temporary

## -----REFLECTION-ON-MOTIVATTION-----

I think the true immediate motivation is getting into a PhD program.
Acieving a PhD and a six pack would giive me the sense of superiority I crave as well as
get me into a community of peers I could enjoy pontificating with.
