### - what makes my heart race?

Joanna - I worry for her, I get upset when she's upset and I love seeing her happy. I worry when she's away and it's dark. I definitely value her in my life greatly. I want her to be in it. Without her my life would be empty. And with her I'm evolving like a pokemon. She's cute, sweet, lovely and would make a great mom. I want to be with her. I just don't know about forever.

I'm afraid of the word forever.
I'm afraid that I will get tired of her and upset her.
I am afraid of having children and being sick of myy life with them.
I'm afraid that after a stretch of bad times I'll be tired of her depression.
I'm afraid of being trapped in a bad relationship and not being able to leave.
I'm afraid of not being attracted to her in 10 years.
I'm afraid of wasting her youth if we break up later.
I'm afraid of the responsibilities of forever.
I'm afraid that I won't be able to handle stress and problems as well as I think.
I'm afraid of not being able to provide for a family.
I'm afraid of losing my freedom and independence.
I'm afraid of regretting commitment.
I'm afraid of the unknown.

Based on fears above, I value:

1. Safety - I want to feel secure in my relationships and not trapped. I want to avoid regret and wasting others' time.
2. Self-direction - I want the freedom and independence to make my own choices. I don't want to lose myself or my freedom in a relationship.
3. Achievement - I want to be able to provide for a family and handle stress/problems well without feeling like I can't. I'm motivated to succeed.

To better understand my motivations:

1. Reflect on past experiences and how they have shaped my fears, desires, and habits
2. Pay attention to patterns in how I judge and compare myself to others
3. Notice what qualities in others trigger positive or negative feelings
4. Evaluate if my motivations align with my core values and ideal self-image
5. Be open to gaining new perspectives that challenge my assumptions
6. Seek feedback from trusted others on how they see my motivations
7. Practice mindfulness and self-reflection to gain deeper self-awareness over time
8. Make small changes to test new behaviors and see how they affect my well-being and relationships
9. Accept that motivations may change and focus on continually growing as a person
